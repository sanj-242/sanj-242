# Hi there 👋
## I'm Sanjana Suresh 👋

### Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Data & AI Enthusiast

[cite_start]I'm a detail-oriented and impact-driven aspiring Data/ML Engineer with a Bachelor of Engineering in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**[cite: 30]. [cite_start]I have a strong foundation in Python, Java, and SQL [cite: 7, 22] [cite_start]and hands-on experience developing ML models and optimizing data workflows[cite: 7, 8].

[cite_start]Currently, I'm passionate about building **resilient system design** and **real-time data applications** [cite: 10][cite_start], leveraging cloud technologies and visualization tools to derive business insights[cite: 9].
